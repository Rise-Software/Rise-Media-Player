## Appearance & design

Created with **WinUI and the latest design ideologies**, **Rise Media Player** is modern while keeping all of the classic features people need. We use **WinUI 2.6/2.7** to keep our user interface, clean, modern and consistent while keeping the **Windows 11 experience**. Although, this app does work on Windows 10* too. We use all of your favourite materials: Mica and Acrylic. We use Microsoft's icons and controls as well as some of our own to create a generally native feeling experience. Our own controls and icons give users a truly personalised experience, being able to choose their own icon packs and with features like compact mode, you can use it on any Windows device!* More details below.

## Downloads, Contribute and the Insider Programme

MSIX packages are available now for the Pre-Alpha 3 build. We aren't going to be available in the Microsoft Store for a while as we will be releasing many builds over the next few months. Trying to approve each build on a regular basis is just not feasible. 

Currently, all users can try out the MSIX packages. When we move to the Store, you must be signed up to the Insider Programme to be able to install. You can do this below!

**If you are an Insider already, just click the Download button and you'll be taken to a page to download!**
