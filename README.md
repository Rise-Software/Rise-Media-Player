## Appearance & design

Created with **WinUI and the latest design ideologies**, **Rise Media Player** is modern while keeping all of the classic features people need. We use **WinUI 2.8 Preview** to keep our user interface, clean, modern and consistent with **Windows 11 UI and UX**. Although, this app does work on **Windows 10** too. We use all of your favourite materials: Mica and Acrylic. We use Microsoft's icons and controls as well as some of our own to create a generally native feeling experience. Our own controls and icons give users a truly personalised experience, being able to choose their own icon packs and with features like compact mode, you can use it on any *Windows device!* **(go to bottom for more details)**
