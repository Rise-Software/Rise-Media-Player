# To-Do for App Development

Since we've not yet completed the first release of the app, here are the things we need to do:

- [x] Make the main project file
- [ ] Make the backend of the app.
- [ ] Implement full use of WinUI 2.6 in the UX.
- [ ] Use AI to implement an automated system throughout the app.
- [ ] Decide a proper name for the app since all that stuff goes into the UI.
- [ ] Make a Deployable solution.
- [ ] Publish it on the Microsoft Store.
